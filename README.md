Dev Hangout is an application build by developers, for developers. This application is designed with the idea in mind to get local developers together, share knowledge, build relationships, and motivate one another in finding their road to success. Starting out as a new developer can be a challenge and with this tool, the goal eventually is to provide developers with local resources so they can overcome those obstacles in a more efficient way
